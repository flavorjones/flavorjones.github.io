a treatise on a Pivotal core practice

(I soloed on this presentation.)

* But you should listen to me, anyway.

A __Practice__ is a path

A Practice is __just one possible__ path

## what this talk is <u>not</u> about

![This is pairing.](images/pair-programming.gif)

* we're not going to talk about how to pair
* you should know to remember to eat a breath mint
* because you have empathy
* we're not going to focus on software development

---

# what this talk <u>is</u> about

* why we pair - what goals are we trying to achieve?
* what we think are the benefits of pairing
* pairing showing up in some unexpected places
* attributes that all pairing scenarios have in common

---

![PHP CEO](images/php-ceo.jpeg)

* my goal is to help y'all have a conversation with this guy about why pairing is valuable

---

## context: XP practices

* let's first talk about the context in which we execute our practices

---

![features chart 1](images/feature-chart-1.jpg)

* using poor practices, you can usually get a good, fast start on software

---

![features chart 2](images/feature-chart-2.jpg)

* but you'll get dimishing returns as the code ossifies

---

![features chart 3](images/feature-chart-3.jpg)

* with good practices you can theoretically add new features at a steady pace forever

---

![features chart 4](images/feature-chart-4.jpg)

* there's a crossover at t1

---

![features chart 5](images/feature-chart-5.jpg)

* if you're exiting before t1, go ahead and throw away all our good XP practices
* this might be the start of an answer to a good question ...

## "When is pair programming worth the trade-off in resources?"

## at pivotal

1. problem space is big and unknown: ✓
2. solution space is big and unknown: ✓
3. you need to build relationships: ✓

* great, but why?
* what problems are we trying to solve at Pivotal?
* what are our goals?

---

# Teaching and Learning

you can do it *forever*

* programming, design, and product skills don't have a biological ceiling like athletes do
* we'll come back to this later

---

# Shared Ownership

*"we"* instead of "us versus them"

succeed or fail *together*

* rotating pairs create a healthy sense of shared ownership
* and improves the bus count

---

# Building a 10x Team

better than a 10x *ninja* *rockstar*

---

# Build the Right Thing

avoid *ratholes*

ask *"why?"*

go *meta*

* helps people focus on the task at hand
* occasionally pop your head out of the specific problem
* talk about whether you're solving the right problem

---

# Build the Thing Right

keep each other *honest*

don't *cut corners*

use *domain language*

---

# Finding the Right Abstractions

* explaining it to your pair is the first step towards identifying the correct abstraction
* meaning less tech debt and better problem-solving

[(I wrote a blog post about this)](http://engineering.pivotal.io/post/abstraction-or-the-gift-of-our-weak-brains/)

---

### What other goals do *you* have when you pair?

---

![PHP CEO](images/php-ceo-one-job.jpeg)

* "can't you just have one person per job?"
* "can't you just do your job right in the first place?"
* nature has evolved pair bonding when the job is difficult

![but cost](images/php-ceo-cost.jpeg)

* but those are all instances where it's cheap to pair

---

![fighter pilots](images/lost-that-loving-feeling.jpg)

"she's lost that loving feeling."

... "i hate it when she does that."

* pilot / navigator
* not just for picking up people in bars

---

![cash and epps](images/cash-epps.jpg)

BTW the "Top Gun" script was the result of pairing, too.

* jim cash and jack epps

---

![jet fighter](images/fighter-jet.jpg)

* there are two seats in some 2g and 3g jet fighters
* this is incredibly expensive
* additional life support systems
* less room for fuel
* 2x the training cost for people
* how did this happen?

# dealing with cognitive overhead

and multitasking

---

"[electronic] systems, intended to *increase* pilot situational
awareness, ended up doing the *exact opposite*, forcing the pilot to
keep his head `in the cockpit' reading gauges and displays, with [lower]
situational awareness ..."

---

"The supersonic aerial equivalent of checking his Facebook on his phone
while he's dodging traffic doing 80 down a busy highway."

---

"Flying a fighter jet is hard and very demanding, and if a guy in the
sky wants to do anything while he's in the air, like dropping bombs,
finding targets, navigating, listening or trying to take pictures,
it's very helpful to have somebody who doesn't need to keep the thing
in the air to help."

---

## Not a tactical / strategic split

WSOs perform both strategic and tactical jobs

```
strategic: navigation
tactical: guiding bombs to targets
```

* it's more about multitasking than it is about separation of concerns

---

![rally racing](images/rally-racing.jpg)

* look! two people in a car racing
* endurance / focus
* driver's cognitive overhead similar to a fighter jet

---

## consider pilot skill versus programming and design skills

Developers, Designers, PMs are always learning and getting better.

* pilot skill has a ceiling, based in biology
* programming skill doesn't really have an effective ceiling
* you can keep learning forever, so pairing forever makes even more sense for software

---

## also: training

Most tactical aircraft also have training versions, which are indeed
two-seaters with dual flight controls with the instructor sitting in
the back.

---

### what do all these things have in common?

---

(1). difficult tasks

```
* explorers
* parents
* rally racers
* fighter jet pilot / wso
* president / treasury secretary
```

---

(2). requires a broad skill set that may not be present in one person

```
* fighter jet pilot / wso
* composer / lyricist
* developer / designer
* designer / PM
* developer / developer
* nerd / businessdog
* director / producer / screenwriter
* president / treasury secretary
```

---

(3). exploration: finding your way through ...

```
* a large problem space
* a large solution space
* the wilderness
* political fights
* scientific discovery
```

---

(4). teaching and learning

```
* fighter jet trainers
* pair programming
* pair design
```

---

(5). shared ownership and shared success

```
* pair programming and design
* parenting
* rally racing
* comedy writing
* exploration
* scientific discovery
```

---

(6). ensuring quality, reducing errors, robust focus on task

```
* rally racing
* fighter jets
* composer / lyricist
* pair programming
* pair design
* president / treasury secretary
* comedy writing
* scientific discovery
```

## there are exceptions, obvs

for every elton john, there's a paul simon

* remember that even though paul simon got better after leaving garfunkel, elton john got worse after he stopped collaborating with bernie taupin

# WDYT?

why *else* do we pair?

why do we pair *all* the time?

is there a time to *not* pair?
