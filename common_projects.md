Nokogiri is currently the most popular XML/HTML parsing library for Ruby developers. It supports CSS
and XPath querying, has push and pull SAX parsers, validates schemas, performs XSLT transformations,
and has a very simple and usable API. It's implemented in Ruby with native extensions in C and Java.

Loofah underlies the default HTML sanitizer in Rails, which can be used to prevent cross-site
scripting (XSS) attacks. It provides a variety of methods to clean or remove unsafe HTML, and
delivers ActiveRecord plugins for Rails applications.

Rails HTML Sanitizer is the default library for sanitizing HTML fragments in Rails applications.

gems. It's the Ruby analog for Python's [`pypa/manylinux`](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux)
project for building Wheels.

The mini_portile project helps gem maintainers integrate native extensions with autoconf projects.

Finally, the Ruby C Extensions Explained is a project that demonstrates and documents a variety of
ways to package and precompile native C code in a Ruby gem, complete with CI pipelines and two
conference talks explaining the approaches.
