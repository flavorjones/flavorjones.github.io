!SLIDE quote

It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds.

&mdash; teddy roosevelt

* Level I - pathological defences (psychotic denial, delusional projection)
* Level II - immature defences (fantasy, projection, passive aggression, acting out)
* Level III - neurotic defences (intellectualization, reaction formation, dissociation, displacement, repression)

# budget and the art <br> of non-budget

* budget is a tool for communicating with the business,
* or, choosing when to not communicate.
* estimation == budget


!SLIDE left incremental

# infrastructure wants to be free

* not really, but nobody wants to pay for it.
* budgets are not unlimited
* particularly painful if delivery schedule is long <span>(which is why we ship soon and ship often)</span>


!SLIDE left advice incremental bullets

# 11. make your infrastructure free

(moderate)

include in your estimates:

* paying off tech debt
* spikes on new technology
* be prepared to justify the estimate, but do not *offer* details!


!SLIDE left question incremental

## why include tech debt and spikes in estimates?

* do you give separate estimates for writing tests?
* avoid non-constructive debate
* nobody in business cares about the craft.<br>get over it.


!SLIDE left advice incremental

# 11. make your infrastructure free

* call YAGNI on unnecessary architecture, and build only what's necessary
* who decides what's necessary?
* YOU DO.

# when infrastructure is delivered for free ...

* there's a multiplier for other teams and projects,

# what's a stealth project?

an experiment or "spike" with a goal to:

* quickly validate a hypothesis
* learn how new technology may be applied
* experiment with radical new product ideas

# why is that important?

* better understand limits of technology and the domain
* demonstrate technology capabilities to the business
* change the conversation

# 12. fund a stealth project
