## agile inceptions 101

the basics of a Pivotal Labs core practice

* what's a core practice? webster's dictionary defines it as ... j/k

---

A __Practice__ is a path

towards a __Goal__ or __Principle__

![path](images/Path.svg)

---

A Practice is __just one possible__ path

*(of many possible Paths)*

towards a Goal or Principle

## a Practice
## is just one possible Path

![paths](images/Three_paths_from_A_to_B.png)

* we should always be re-evaluating how we help clients reach their goals
* LUXR is bringing lots of experimentation and new tools
  * i'm not going to talk about that today
* let's focus on one particularly well-trodden path
  * the first inception for a project,
  * when unknowns are many,
  * and teams haven't gelled yet

---

## meta-agile

"do what works"

* means:
  * moses didn't come down the mountain
  * what we currently do is constantly evolving
  * and it's different from how we did it N years ago
* we need to be able to respond to change
  * and to different clients
  * and to different client goals
* anything else is waterfall
* who judges what's working? YOU DO.

## Shared Understanding

* sounds touchy-feely, insubstantial for a one- or two-day meeting
* why is this important?

---

## Shared Understanding

at the heart of most (all?) of our practices

* retros
* IPMs
* pairing
* TDD/BDD
* gherkin as-a/i-want/so-that

---

## Shared Understanding

everything is at risk without it

* "what happens if client staff aren't all on the same page?"
* "what happens if we aren't on the same page as the client?"
* unless we walk out of the room with a shared understanding, everything else is at risk
  * e.g.: priority churn
  * e.g.: refusal to accept delivered stories
  * e.g.: refusal to pair
  * e.g.: refusal to pay

## ✌typical inception✌

let's see if we can derive an agenda from first principles

_(to the whiteboard!)_

---

## possibly-useful questions

what are the __goals__ of an inception?

are there things we want to __avoid__ addressing?

what might put the goals at __risk__?

who are __typical people__ in the room?

... and what do they want to get out of it?

* goals
  * shared understanding ... about what?
    * business domain
    * business goals
    * ubiquitous language
  * mitigating risks
  * write stories
  * estimate stories
* prioritize the goals
* anti-goals
  * write stories?
  * estimate stories?
* risks and mitigations
  * lack of language → dictionary
  * off-topic conversations → parking lot
  * too many voices → use notecards
  * failure to prioritize → 2x2 quadrants with arbitrary axes
  * too much emotion/baggage → independent facilitator
* people
  * facilitator
  * CEO
  * CTO
  * project manager
  * product manager
  * designer
  * developer
  * Labs CL

how did that brainstorming session feel?

* dude, did we just build some shared understanding?

---

_you just been incepted!_

## antipatterns

it's the first time many clients are face-to-face with our process and practices

* many of the same antipatterns that show up during an engagement
  * no single, accountable, knowledgable product owner
  * command-and-control: "do what we say, staff-aug!"
  * thinking that "done done" is a thing
  * refusal to acknowledge unknowns
  * refusal to re-examine assumptions
  * "let's pick this crazy technology"
  * "let's dive into implementation details"
  * client feeling threatened by questions
* too many people in the room
* unprepared client (e.g., the learning-game client)

---

## other tips and tricks

* develop ubiquitous language: dictionary
* stem unconstructive conversation: parking log
* more-flexible whiteboard: use post-its for recategorization and reprioritization
* less verbal communication: use notecards
* huge scope: break risks down by epics, and loop that back into prioritization
* refusal to prioritize: use 2x2 to force decisions and prioritization decisions

---

## the independent facilitator

when is it necessary?

* is it always a good idea to have an independent 3rd party facilitating?
* what if you have an agenda you're trying to drive the room towards?
* why don't you have an agenda? don't you have an opinion?
* opinions aren't bad.
  * Gust, etc.

---

## scoping notes

we cover all this in the scoping, no?

* we'll use notes as a starting point
* but things often change radically between scoping and inception:
  * staffing changes
  * gained knowledge
  * tech spike
  * different people in the room

---

## scoping notes

we need to re-build the shared understanding

* with the whole team
* with the stakeholders
* assimilating things learned in the meantime

---

## story writing and estimation

start with epics

* on blue notecards

---

## story writing and estimation

_"registration and login"_

---

## story writing and estimation

put roles under the epic

* on yellow notecards

---

## story writing and estimation

_"as an anonymous guest, I should be able to ..."_

_"as a registered user, I should be able to ..."_

---

## story writing and estimation

write stories (quickly)

arrange in dependency order under the role

* on white notecards

---

## story writing and estimation

_"... click on a 'Start Fizzywigging!' CTA"_

_"... enter my email and password"_

_"... enter my username and password"_

_"... click on 'Forgot Password'"_

---

## story writing and estimation

point stories as usual

---

## story writing and estimation

figure out the team's probable initial velocity

* shuffle up notecards
  * after noting where they were
* deal a hand to each developer
* each person chooses a set of stories that they think will take a pair-week to do
* compare and chat
* repeat until team arrives at a consensus

---

is the hour over yet?

---

that's all I got for now.
