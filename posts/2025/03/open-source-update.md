# Open Source Update

2025-03-08, originally sent directly to open-source sponsors
{: .text-sm .italic .opacity-75 }

Hello!

I'm trying something new! I'm going to start writing a periodic post about the open source work I'm doing.

Because this post is trying to cover three months, it's a bit long, and if I'm honest it feels a bit overwhelming to present you with this list. I apologize if it's not-so-interesting! I'm hoping the next one will be a bit more conversational and quite a bit shorter. Please let me know if this is helpful and informational, or if you'd like to see more info (or less!) in the next one.

So far in 2025, here's an overview of the work I've done in the Ruby open-source community ...

## Nokogiri

### Releases

- [Release v1.18.2 / 2024-01-19 · sparklemotion/nokogiri](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/releases/tag/v1.18.2)
- [Release v1.18.3 / 2025-02-18 · sparklemotion/nokogiri](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/releases/tag/v1.18.3)
    - and the accompanying GHSA [Nokogiri updates packaged libxml2 to 2.13.6 to resolve CVE-2025-24928 and CVE-2024-56171 · Advisory · sparklemotion/nokogiri](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/security/advisories/GHSA-vvfq-8hwr-qm4m)

### Contributions

- Worked a bit with the upstream libxml2 maintainer, Nick Wellnhofer, to reproduce xpath issues in [XPath optimizations (!293) · Merge requests · GNOME / libxml2 · GitLab](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/merge_requests/293)
- Working on [XPath performance improvements · Issue #3403 · sparklemotion/nokogiri](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/3403), which will land once libxml 2.14 is released.
    - These changes, when combined with the upstream libxml2 improvements, show a stunning speedup of ~12x on XPath queries in my benchmarks. 🚀
- Investigated [Nokogiri::XML::Document#css no longer matches namespaced XML attributes · Issue #3411 · sparklemotion/nokogiri](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/3411)
    - And fixed it in [fix(css-selector): default XML namespace is not applied to wildcard by flavorjones · Pull Request #3413 · sparklemotion/nokogiri](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/pull/3413)
- Did another round of html5lib error-message-correcting in [Update tests for relaxed select parser by josepharhar · Pull Request #178 · html5lib/html5lib-tests](https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests/pull/178)
- Created [Deprecate `Nokogiri::HTML4::ElementDescription` · Issue #3443 · sparklemotion/nokogiri](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/3443), which will be deprecated in an upcoming release.
- Wrote up an issue [Update parse options to reflect modern libxml usage · Issue #3439 · sparklemotion/nokogiri](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/3439)
- Closed [RFC: Increase `Nokogiri::Gumbo::DEFAULT_MAX_ERRORS` to a positive number · sparklemotion/nokogiri · Discussion #3248](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/discussions/3248) after much consideration.

The big improvement this cycle was for all the build images to contain updated Ruby versions and dependencies, and some features to help gem maintainers work with those images.

- Created [dep: update images to rake-compiler v1.2.9 by flavorjones · Pull Request #139 · rake-compiler/rake-compiler-dock](https://github.com/rake-compiler/rake-compiler-dock/pull/139)

I'm also preparing for the next release:

- Reviewed and expanded [Drop support for Ruby 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6 by ianks · Pull Request #153 · rake-compiler/rake-compiler-dock](https://github.com/rake-compiler/rake-compiler-dock/pull/153)
- Briefly investigated the build problem in [Set RUBY_CC_VERSION using RakeCompilerDock.set_ruby_cc_version by stanhu · Pull Request #167 · mudge/re2](https://github.com/mudge/re2/pull/167) which seems to be due to rake-compiler's fake.rb rbconfig. 🤷
    - And wrote a workaround in [feat: allow easier selection of the ruby run in the container by flavorjones · Pull Request #151 · rake-compiler/rake-compiler-dock](https://github.com/rake-compiler/rake-compiler-dock/pull/151/files), which I'm not sure is needed, so I haven't merged yet.
