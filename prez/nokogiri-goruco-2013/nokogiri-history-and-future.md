# Nokogiri

As of this morning, Nokogiri has been downloaded 11,755,224 times.

<br>

(For comparison, Rails is at around 24 million downloads.)

## How did that happen?

I shall tell you.


!SLIDE

But first ...


!SLIDE

# Etymology

What does it mean?


!SLIDE

![Nokogiri saw](nokogiri-saw.jpg)

<br>

It's a saw. You know, for cutting through trees. Of XML.


!SLIDE

# Origins

The year was 2008.


!SLIDE

## 2008

* [Rails 2.1](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/5/31/rails-2-1-time-zones-dirty-caching-gem-dependencies-caching-etc/) and [Ruby 1.8.7](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2008/05/31/ruby-1-8-7-has-been-released/) are released.
* 'Slumdog Millionaire' and 'Wall-E' in theaters.
* Oil hits $100/barrel for the first time.
* Stock markets crash. (Thanks, subprime lenders.)
* LHC goes online.
* Barack Obama is elected president.
* NY Gov. Eliot Spitzer resigns in disgrace.

## How did DL work out?


!SLIDE

## DL was slow. Really slow.

(But more on dynamic bindings later.)


!SLIDE

## Origins

We quickly moved to writing a C extension to bind to libxml2.


!SLIDE

## Origins

The toughest problem writing a C extensions?

### Debugging libxml2's memory management model.


!SLIDE

## Debugging Memory Issues and C extensions

Learn these tools!

- `valgrind`
- `perftools.rb` (Thanks to Aman Gupta!)


!SLIDE

## API Design

We boldly stole the best XML API we could find ...

## API Design by Theft

## Meaningless Statistic

By January 2009, we had:

- 1,510 lines of Ruby code
- 1,760 lines of C code


!SLIDE

## Community acceptance


!SLIDE

Here are some BS performance stats from the time:

![bs-stats](bullshit-stats.png)


!SLIDE

People in the past argued a lot about XML library benchmarks.

Sigh.

# The Dawn of JRuby


!SLIDE

JRuby didn't fully support C extensions.

This was a problem for JRubyists who wanted to use Nokogiri.


!SLIDE

# I had a dream.


!SLIDE

One codebase that ran on MRI, Rubinius and JRuby.


!SLIDE

# My FFI Phase


!SLIDE

# What's FFI?

Foreign Function Interface

Ruby calling native C code directly.


!SLIDE

# I had a dream.

One codebase that bound to libxml2 on any platform.


!SLIDE

# Ruby FFI

A cross-platform Ruby API for accessing native C code.


!SLIDE

# Ruby FFI

Shout out to Wayne Meissner (@wmeissner).

FFI is basically magic.


!SLIDE

## My FFI Phase

I spent most of January -- May 2009 rewriting all the C code in Ruby.


!SLIDE

## My FFI Phase

It was painful.



!SLIDE

## Meaningful Statistic

It took **3,049** lines of Ruby code

to reproduce **4,150** lines of C code.


!SLIDE

# PAIN: Writing C in Ruby

![ffi-1](ffi-example-1b.png)


!SLIDE

## FFI port

Good: **It worked!**

<br>

(Golf clap.)


!SLIDE

## FFI port

Bad: **"Segfault-driven development"**

<br>

Handicapped by lack of compile-time checking.


!SLIDE

## FFI port

Bad: **Portable string handling is hard.**

<br>

JVM GC edge cases.


!SLIDE

## FFI port

Bad: **FFI code not any clearer than C**

<br>

Requires you think in C and translate to Ruby.


!SLIDE

![ffi-2](ffi-example-2b.png)

<br>

DO NOT WANT.


!SLIDE

## FFI port

**Really** Bad: Huge performance penalty.


!SLIDE

![ffi-chart-1](ffi-chart-1.png)


!SLIDE

## FFI port

And worst of all ...


!SLIDE

Let me tell you a story about RubyConf 2009.


!SLIDE

# All these choices suck.

![choices](choices.png)


!SLIDE

# Outcome

Killed the FFI port.

Unpublished blog post.

<br>

:(


!SLIDE

# FFI Lessons

* If you care about performance, you need to write native extensions
* If you care about multi-platform, you need to support at least two codebases
* If you don't care about either, then FFI is for you!


!SLIDE

# Installation

## Installation Problems and Solutions


!SLIDE

## Installation Problems and Solutions

- Windows
- JRuby
- everybody else


!SLIDE

## Installation on Windows

### It's complicated.


!SLIDE

Instant poll: Any Ruby Windows developers out there?


!SLIDE

Nobody has a build toolchain.

Nobody has libxml2 installed on their system.


!SLIDE

## Solution

Cross-compile and package the DLLs with the gem:

- libxml2
- libxslt
- libiconv
- zlib


!SLIDE

"Fat Binary" gems

    $ ls -l gems
    total 21652
    -rw-r--r-- 1 miked 9870336 Mar 11 17:31 nokogiri-1.5.7-x86-mingw32.gem
    -rw-r--r-- 1 miked 9870336 Mar 11 17:31 nokogiri-1.5.7-x86-mswin32-60.gem
    -rw-r--r-- 1 miked  221184 Mar 11 17:31 nokogiri-1.5.7.gem


!SLIDE

**Fat** because we have to compile against multiple rubies:

- Ruby 1.8.7
- Ruby 1.9.3
- Ruby 2.0 (as of nokogiri 1.5.7)

!SLIDE

## Windows

[Luis Lavena](https://github.com/luislavena) ([@luislavena](https://twitter.com/luislavena)) supports the Windows build toolchain basically single-handedly.

* `rake-compiler`
* `mini_portile`
* infinite patience

He rules!


!SLIDE

## Installation on JRuby

Nokogiri's JRuby port uses specific libraries:

- `isorelax`
- `jing`
- `nekodtd` and `nekohtml`
- `xerces`

These may not be installed on the target system.


!SLIDE

## Solution

Build and package `jar` files!

    $ ls lib/*jar
    lib/isorelax.jar
    lib/jing.jar
    lib/nekodtd.jar
    lib/nekohtml.jar
    lib/xercesImpl.jar
    

!SLIDE

The JRuby gem is also a "Fat Binary"

    $ ls -l gems
    total 21652
    -rw-r--r-- 1 miked 2204160 Mar 11 17:31 nokogiri-1.5.7-java.gem
    -rw-r--r-- 1 miked 9870336 Mar 11 17:31 nokogiri-1.5.7-x86-mingw32.gem
    -rw-r--r-- 1 miked 9870336 Mar 11 17:31 nokogiri-1.5.7-x86-mswin32-60.gem
    -rw-r--r-- 1 miked  221184 Mar 11 17:31 nokogiri-1.5.7.gem


!SLIDE

## Installation on MRI(-ish)

Like any ordinary C extension, we compile on installation.


!SLIDE

## Installation on MRI(-ish)

Unlike most C extensions, we have unwieldy external dependencies:

- libxml2
- libxslt

This is kind of lame.


!SLIDE

## External system dependencies

This is lame because

* everyone has different libxml2 versions installed
* ... in different places
* ... with different (possibly buggy) behavior


!SLIDE

## PAIN FOR YOU

![installation](installation.png)


!SLIDE

## PAIN FOR ME

    int is_2_6_16(void)
    {
      return (strcmp(xmlParserVersion, "20616") <= 0) ? 1 : 0 ;
    }
    
    if (   reparentee->type == XML_TEXT_NODE
        && pivot->type      == XML_TEXT_NODE
        && is_2_6_16(
       ) {
      /* work around a string-handling bug in libxml 2.6.16.
         we'd rather leak than segfault. */
      pivot->content = xmlStrdup(pivot->content);
    }


!SLIDE

Have I told you about libxml 2.9.0 yet?


!SLIDE

"Wait."


!SLIDE

"Didn't you **just say** there's a toolchain for compiling autoconf
projects and binding to them at gem installation time?"


!SLIDE

Dude/Dudette!


!SLIDE

You've been paying attention!


!SLIDE

Thank you!


!SLIDE

# I'm Happy to Announce

(drumroll)

!SLIDE

## Nokogiri 1.6.0

Packages libxml2 and libxslt inside the gem.


!SLIDE

## Nokogiri 1.6.0

Installation will Just Workâ„¢.

You can still use your system libraries if you really want to.


!SLIDE

## Nokogiri 1.6.0

(Pending me running "gem push" in a few minutes.)


!SLIDE

## Naming Things is Easy!

I hereby invent the "Fat Source" gem.

- better serialization / pretty-printing
- faster SAX parsing (see the [fairy-wing throwdown](http://blog.flavorjon.es/2011/05/fairy-wing-wrapup-nokogiri-performance.html))
- better `Node` attributes API
- CSS query parsing (pseudo-selectors and JQuery compat)
- `Fragment` boogs
- better custom XPath handler API
- general encodings improvement
- `Reader`


!SLIDE

Let's talk afterwards. (Preferably, on the boat.)
