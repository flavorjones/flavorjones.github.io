## Hey there,

I'm *Mike Dalessio*, and I'm just this guy, you know? I've been a software developer for over 30 years and still can't believe I get paid to do what I love.

For the last decade, I've been working on [open-source projects](projects.html) focused on improving
*developer experience*. Most recently at [Shopify](https://shopify.com), leading their [Ruby and
Rails superteam](https://railsatscale.com). Before that, leading 400 engineers working on [Cloud
Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) at [Pivotal and VMware](https://tanzu.vmware.com/). My
passion for DevEx goes back to the early part of my career, when I designed and built the developer
SDK for [Bloomberg](https://bloomberg.com)'s next-gen UI.
