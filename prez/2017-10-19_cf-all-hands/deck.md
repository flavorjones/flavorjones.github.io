What's the leadership team doing?

<div class=notes>
it comes down to, are we as a company and an R&D organization, sharing information appropriately
</div>

---

_Information sharing_

push v pull models

<div class=notes>
push tends to be more effective, and so we rely on it
</div>

_Information sharing_

weekly leadership drumbeat email

they deserve a complete talk by themselves, which i'm planning to do next month

<div class=notes>
there have been a lot of false starts with the technical career path
</div>

Labs era: _Technical Expert_ role

<div class=notes>
our own david stevenson was once the performance technical expert
hard to own a role like this in the labs work cycle where you're allocated to a client
</div>

---

Recently: _Specialist_ role

<div class=notes>
for cross-cutting expertise like networking and security
it's not clear how to set those people up for success, but we're continuing to iterate on it and discuss it
</div>

someone who takes a more direct guiding role with a subset of related teams

EL for redis, services enablement, and osbapi
EL for Garden and Groot

ensures tight feedback loops
teams gave positive feedback and found it easier to get support and perspective
</div>

Experiment: _Engineering Lead_ role

â†’ NYC

â†’ Toronto

<div class=notes>
Similar role in NYC for Windows containers and bosh
slightly different role in Toronto, day to day activities are different, but goal is to have closer technical leadership to the team

Experiment: _Engineering Lead_ role

Highly contextual, activities vary from team to team.

Formalizing the _Engineering Lead_ role

Open questions ...

Formalizing the _Engineering Lead_ role

Does this encroach on the anchor role?

<div class=notes>
we're looking for people with strong communication and consensus-building skills to provide guidance without being overbearing.
</div>

---

Formalizing the _Engineering Lead_ role

Is this a change in title or comp?

<div class=notes>
anchor role â†’ not immediately
</div>

---

Formalizing the _Engineering Lead_ role

When is this coming to other offices?

---

Formalizing the _Engineering Lead_ role

What's the next step for the role?

---

Formalizing the _Engineering Lead_ role

* Open call for an Engineering Lead in London
* Continue to iterate
* Continue the discussion of formalizing the role in other offices

---

Call to Action

---

Call to Action: I want to talk to people about these things.

* Hiring
* Diversity and Inclusion
* Transparency
* "Flow"
* Career Path

<div class=notes>
I will be reaching out to some individual, and local D&I grassroots groups. If you want to chat, I will make time.
</div>

---

Next time:

* More on hiring a diverse set of employees
* More on building a diverse leadership pipeline
* More on "flow"
* More on technical career paths

---

Thank you.
