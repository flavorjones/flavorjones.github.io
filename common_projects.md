Nokogiri is currently the most popular XML/HTML parsing library for Ruby developers. It supports CSS

Loofah underlies the default HTML sanitizer in Rails, which can be used to prevent cross-site

ways to package and precompile native C code in a Ruby gem, complete with CI pipelines and two
conference talks explaining the approaches.
