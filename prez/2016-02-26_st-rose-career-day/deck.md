## ✌Software Engineering✌

✌Software Development✌

✌Computer Progamming✌

* "Software Engineering" is a euphemism (phrase) for something.
* Let's try to be more specific.
* If my grandfather asked me what I did, what would I say?

## Me

Mike Dalessio

Engineering Director for Pivotal Software

I work on the Cloud Foundry project


---

In Middle School I Wanted to be a Novelist

![monkey typing](images/monkey-typing.gif)

* I love the written word
* I was good at it
* I chose my high school to get into a good English program


---

*Writing* = Expressing a thought so your reader can understand.

"Explaining"

---

In High School I Fell in Love With Science

![monkey typing](images/science.jpg)

* I picked my college to get into a good Physics program


---

*Science* = figuring out puzzles in the real world.

"How to Do Things"

---

In College I worked hard to get two research assistantships.

![JHU](images/pha-jhu.png) ![STScI](images/stsci.jpg)


---

Where I wrote software to analyze data from space probes and telescopes.

![voyager](images/voyager.png) ![hubble](images/hubble.jpg)


---

*Software* = *Writing* + *Science*

"Explaining <u>to Computers</u> How to Do Things"


---

I got some good jobs.

---

Then I got a great job.

---

I realized that most software is terrible.

![gp](images/great-plains.jpg)


---

Because it doesn't consider the people who are going to use it.

![angry](images/angry-user.gif)


---

**Good** *Software* =

*Writing* + *Science* + *Empathy*

"Explaining to Computers How to Do Things ... <u>For People</u>"


---

Which makes people happy.

### Evening: More Software?

Yes, I do it for fun, too.

(Ask me about "Open Source Software" if you're interested.)


---

## "Explaining to Computers"

What do we say?

How do we say it?

(Demonstration!)


---

## "Explaining to Computers"

What languages do they speak?

Just a few: Smalltalk, C, Go, Ruby, Java, Python

### But ...


---

## Literate Programming

![knuth](images/knuth.jpg)

"Instead of instructing a computer what to do, let us concentrate on
explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do."


---

## Literate Programming

![abelson](images/abelson.jpg)

“Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally
for machines to execute.”


---

## Explaining

What skills do you need to *explain*?

What skills do you need to *explain to a computer*?

Are they different?


---

## "Things for People"

How do you know what people want?

How do you know if you've made them happy?


---

## Ask Them.

Ask people what they need.

Build something small.

Check if people like it.

Adjust if necessary, build a little more.


---

Good Software is more like a bonsai tree than a bridge.

![bonsai](images/bonsai.png) ![bonsai](images/bonsai-2.png)


---

## But ...

People can be difficult to communicate with.

Watch out for the "X-Y Problem"!


---

"I need to borrow your bike."

"Why?"

"To go to the store."

"Why?"

"To buy a new basketball."

"Why?"

"Because I lost mine."

"No, you left it at my house."


---

## Let's Write Some Software

Imagine we have a robot that can walk around the room, pick things up,
and deliver them to your desk.

Write a program telling the robot how to deliver something to you.

*Hint: I will be the robot.*


---

*(1) Pair up with someone.*

Find a partner. One of you will be the Researcher, and the other
person decides what they want delivered.


---

*(2) Research.*

Needy person: Imagine you're an astronaut/president/landscaper/crazy
person and need an object for a silly reason.

### "I need a piece of paper because I'm a Senator and need to write a new law."


---

*(2) Research.*

Researcher: Ask your partner who they are and what they need that's in
the room. Figure out what their job is and why they want the
object. Ask lots of questions.

### Make sure you understand the story behind the need.


---

*(3) Collaborate.*

Write a program on paper for your robot to follow.

### Test your program if you need to!

(I'll be the robot.)
